# Model Performance Analysis and Visualization

This task analyzes and visualizes the deviations of predicted model outputs (floor vs. ceiling corners) against ground truth labels. It includes functionality for data processing, performance metrics calculation, and generation of meaningful plots to evaluate the model.

## Features

- Load and process JSON data containing model predictions and ground truth values.
- Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and prediction accuracy.
- Generate:
  - Histograms for deviation distributions.
  - Boxplots for floor vs. ceiling deviation means.
  - Scatter plots to explore relationships between metrics.
- Save plots for further review and analysis.


## Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
